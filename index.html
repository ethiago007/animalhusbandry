                <p>
                    Farm animals require proper care and management such as shelter, feeding, breeding (by artificial
                    insemination), and disease control. This is known as animal husbandry.
                    In other words, the agricultural practices of breeding and raising livestock is called animal
                    husbandry.
                    Domesticated animals of any breed or population of animals that are intentionally kept in an
                    agricultural setting for the benefit of human beings are referred to as ‘livestock’.
                    Animal husbandry deals with the care and breeding of animals like buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis), Cows
                    (Bos indicus), pigs, horses, cattle, sheep, camels, goats, etc., by humans for various products like
                    milk, meat, wool, etc. Poultry farming and fisheries are also considered as part of animal
                    husbandry.
                </p>
                <p> Animal husbandry is the branch of agriculture concerned with animals that are raised for meat,
                    fibre, milk, or
                    other products. It includes day-to-day care, selective breeding and the raising of livestock.
                    Husbandry has a
                    long history, starting with the Neolithic revolution when animals were first domesticated, from
                    around 13,000 BC
                    onwards, predating farming of the first crops. By the time of early civilisations such as ancient
                    Egypt, cattle,
                    sheep, goats and pigs were being raised on farms.

                    Major changes took place in the Columbian exchange when Old World livestock were brought to the New
                    World, and
                    then in the British Agricultural Revolution of the 18th century, when livestock breeds like the
                    Dishley Longhorn
                    cattle and Lincoln Longwool sheep were rapidly improved by agriculturalists such as Robert Bakewell
                    to yield
                    more meat, milk, and wool. A wide range of other species such as horse, water buffalo, llama, rabbit
                    and guinea
                    pig are used as livestock in some parts of the world. Insect farming, as well as aquaculture of
                    fish, molluscs,
                    and crustaceans, is widespread. Modern animal husbandry relies on production systems adapted to the
                    type of land
                    available. Subsistence farming is being superseded by intensive animal farming in the more developed
                    parts of
                    the world, where for example beef cattle are kept in high density feedlots, and thousands of
                    chickens may be
                    raised in broiler houses or batteries. On poorer soil such as in uplands, animals are often kept
                    more
                    extensively, and may be allowed to roam widely, foraging for themselves.

                    Most livestock are herbivores, except for pigs and chickens which are omnivores. Ruminants like
                    cattle and sheep
                    are adapted to feed on grass; they can forage outdoors, or may be fed entirely or in part on rations
                    richer in
                    energy and protein, such as pelleted cereals. Pigs and poultry cannot digest the cellulose in
                    forage, and
                    require other high-protein foods.</p>
